# # Task_6 Password Strength Analysis

## üîç Objective
 Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

## üõ† Tools Used
- Bitwarden password checker
- Kaspersky password checker
- Chrome (Browser)

## üß™ Steps Performed
1. Online password strength checker **https://bitwarden.com/password-strength**
2. Tried various character combinations
3. Learned and analysed dictionary attacks and password strength


## üìä Output
- Various character combination strengths and scores


## üß† Learnings

  A strong password should be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters so that it's harder to crack using any dictionary attacks or brute force attacks. Common passwords and passwords like mobile numbers are easy to crack using brute force attacks by running all possible combinations of the specified characters. Complex passwords significantly enhance security by making it exponentially harder for attackers to compromise accounts through various methods. It may take too long for the cracking process, like months or years. 

 # Brute Force Attacks
   A type of password attack that tries every possible combination of passwords, encryption keys, or other credentials until the correct one is found. It's akin to trying every possible combination on a padlock until it opens.
 # Dictionary Attacks 
   A dictionary attack is a type of brute-force attack that attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system, account, or encrypted data by systematically trying every word in a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously compromised passwords. A popular wordlist used for dictionary attacks is rockyou.txt and common.txt.
   
  # TOOLS
  - **ffuf:** is a fast web fuzzer that can be used for directory enumeration, virtual host discovery, and parameter fuzzing, aiding in finding paths or inputs to brute-force.
  - **Burp Suite (Intruder):** A web vulnerability scanner and proxy, Burp Suite's "Intruder" module is highly effective for brute-forcing web forms, HTTP authentication, and other web-based login mechanisms. It offers sophisticated options for payload generation and attack configurations.
  - **Gobuster:** A brute-force scanner for discovering hidden directories, virtual hosts, and subdomains on web servers. While not directly a password cracker, it's used for enumeration to find potential entry points for further brute-forcing.
  - **Hashcat:** is incredibly powerful for cracking a wide variety of hash types using various attack modes like dictionary, brute-force, hybrid, mask, and rule-based attacks.
